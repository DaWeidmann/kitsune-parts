# Spot Micro | Kitsune > Parts

This repository contains the 3D printable parts for Spot Micro Kitsune, my personal take on a quadruped robot like @KDY0523's [SpotMicro](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283).

## Repository structure

All the parts and the assembly instructions inside 'SpotMicroESP32_v1_0_0' are directly taken from Michael Kubina's [SpotMicroESP32](https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32) project which is released under the GPL v3.

For both optical and functional reasons I redesigned some of the parts. Those can be found inside the 'Modifications' folder. All those files are licensed under the [Creative Commons - Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.
